**Note**  
A PID (process identification number) is an identification number that is uniquely and automatically assigned to each process when it is created on a Unix-like OS  
A process is an executing (i.e., running) instance of a program.  
The process init is the only process that will always have the same PID (value 1). The because init is always the first process on the system and is the ancestor of all other processes.

Information on current processes is stored in the /proc filesystem, which consists of kernel data that changes in real time.

A signal is an event generated by the UNIX and Linux sysstem in response to some condion. Upon receipt of a signal, a process may take action.

The two type of signals:  
* **Maskable**: signals which can be changed or ignore by the user (e.g., ^C)
* **Non-Maskable**: signals which cannot be changed or ignored by the user.
