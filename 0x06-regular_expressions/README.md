**Note**
A regular expression, commonly called "regexp", is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It is mainly used in pattern matching with strings, or strings matching (i.e. it operates like a "find and replace command").  
while it is a very powerful tool, it is also very dangerous because of its complexity.

**super classic joke in the industry:** Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems.
