* All bash script passes Shellcheck
* ``#!/usr/bin/env bash`` is used instead of ``#!/bin/bash``

The advantage of #!/usr/bin/env bash is that it will use whatever bash executable appears first in the running user's $PATH variable hence making script more portable.  
if there is no directory as /usr/bin/env, you can use a symbolic link to point to correct path for env command.
